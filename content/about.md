# Happy to see you here!

I am a curios person who loves to learn new things which is why I like my job as a software developer so much, there is always something new to learn and that motivates me every day. Working full stack and agile is my preferred way of working. Building a new feature across the stack and seeing it go to production is just a great feeling. My principles when it comes to coding that I do my best to follow every day is:

> Simplicity.
>
> Add new dependencies with care.
>
> Write clear and clean.
>
> Write tests.

I prefer to work in self-moderated teams with people from different disciplines. My ambition is to contribute with good code and good spirit to my team.
